# OutputParser
Simple script to parse output file of CNN and generate pyplots

Just download the script and run the main file - it expects the output-file to be analyzed to be in the same directory as main.py with the name out.txt (but can be changed easily in line 5)


## out.txt
the script ignores lines it is not tasked to look at - a sample file can be found in the root directory: out.txt





# requirements
numpy
